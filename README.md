CUL - The C++ Useful Library
===

The C++ Useful Library is designed to help students and new users to C++ learn about and see in action basic functions that are commonly implemented in simple to medium programs. The idea is also to give a "useful" library for those who wish to spend less time trying to get simple tasks such as fetching arguments belonging to tags or generating generic ascii art and want to spend more time on the task at hand.

This repository was made by the inspirations of Jason Harrison and the tedious C++ lab requirements of Andrew Kult

How To Use
===

The library is broken into several subfolders containing header files that can be included into your project for use. Everything is self contained within the header with the intent to minimize the
number of dependencies, allow users to drag and drop the files and use them, and allow users to change the file if desired for thier own purposes.

Simply clone the github repository, and copy out the files you would like, move them to your project directory, include them, and code away!
