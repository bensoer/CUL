CUL - The C++ Useful Library
===

The C++ Useful Library is designed to help students and new users to C++ learn about and see in action basic functions that are commonly implemented in simple to medium programs. The idea is also to give a "useful" library for those who wish to spend less time trying to get simple tasks such as fetching arguments belonging to tags or generating generic ascii art and want to spend more time on the task at hand.

This repository was made by the inspirations of Jason Harrison and the tedious C++ lab requirements of Andrew Kult
